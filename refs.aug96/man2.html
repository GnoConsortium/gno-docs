<p><b>DESCRIPTION</b></p>

<dir>
    <li><dir>
            <li><b>Sz</b> (send ZMODEM) uses the ZMODEM, YMODEM
                or XMODEM error correcting protocol to send one
                or more files over a dial-in serial port to a
                variety of programs running under PC-DOS, CP/M,
                Unix, VMS, and other operating systems.<p>This is
                a shareware program copyrighted by Omen
                Technology INC.</p>
                <p><b>Sz</b> sends one or more files with ZMODEM
                protocol.</p>
                <p>ZMODEM greatly simplifies file transfers
                compared to XMODEM. In addition to a friendly
                user interface, ZMODEM provides Personal Computer
                and other users an efficient, accurate, and
                robust file transfer method.</p>
                <p>ZMODEM provides complete END-TO-END data
                integrity between application programs. ZMODEM's
                32 bit CRC catches errors that sneak into even
                the most advanced networks.</p>
                <p>Advanced file management features include
                AutoDownload (Automatic file Download initiated
                without user intervention), Display of individual
                and total file lengths and transmission time
                estimates, Crash Recovery, selective file
                transfers, and preservation of exact file date
                and length.</p>
                <p>The -y option instructs the receiver to open
                the file for writing unconditionally. The -a
                option causes the receiver to convert Unix
                newlines to PC-DOS carriage returns and
                linefeeds.</p>
                <p><b>Sb</b> sends one or more files with YMODEM
                or ZMODEM protocol. The initial ZMODEM
                initialization is not sent. When requested by the
                receiver, <b>sb</b> supports YMODEM-g with
                &quot;cbreak&quot; tty mode, XON/XOFF flow
                control, and interrupt character set to CAN (^X).
                YMODEM-g increases YMODEM throughput over error
                free channels (direct connection, X.PC, etc.) by
                disabling error recovery.</p>
                <p>On Unix systems, additional information about
                the file is transmitted. If the receiving program
                uses this information, the transmitted file
                length controls the exact number of bytes written
                to the output dataset, and the modify time and
                file mode are set accordingly.</p>
                <p><b>Sx</b> sends a single file with XMODEM or
                XMODEM-1k protocol (sometimes incorrectly called
                &quot;ymodem&quot;). The user must supply the
                file name to both sending and receiving programs.</p>
                <p>If <b>sz</b> is invoked with $SHELL set and if
                that variable contains the string rsh or rksh
                (restricted shell), sz operates in restricted
                mode. Restricted mode restricts pathnames to the
                current directory and PUBDIR (usually
                /usr/spool/uucppublic) and/or subdirectories
                thereof.</p>
                <p>The fourth form sends a single COMMAND to a
                ZMODEM receiver for execution. Zcommand exits
                with the COMMAND return value. If COMMAND
                includes spaces or characters special to the
                shell, it must be quoted.</p>
                <p>The fifth form sends a single COMMAND to a
                ZMODEM receiver for execution. Zcommandi exits as
                soon as the receiver has correctly received the
                command, before it is executed.</p>
                <p>The sixth form (sz -TT) attempts to output all
                256 code combinations to the terminal. If you are
                having difficulty sending files, this command
                lets you see which character codes are being
                eaten by the operating system.</p>

<p><b>TESTING FEATURE</b></p>

<dir>
    <li><dir>
            <li>The command &quot;sz -T file&quot; exercises the
                Attn sequence error recovery by commanding errors
                with unterminated packets. The receiving program
                should complain five times about binary data
                packets being too long. Each time sz is
                interrupted, it should send a ZDATA header
                followed by another defective packet. If the
                receiver does not detect five long data packets,
                the Attn sequence is not interrupting the sender,
                and the Myattn string in sz.c must be modified.<p>After
                5 packets, sz stops the &quot;transfer&quot; and
                prints the total number of characters
                &quot;sent&quot; (Tcount). The difference between
                Tcount and 5120 represents the number of
                characters stored in various buffers when the
                Attn sequence is generated.</p>

<p><b>NOTES</b></p>

<dir>
    <li><dir>
            <li>When using buffered modems at high speed,
                particular attention must be paid to flow
                control. The modem and Unix must agree on the
                flow control method. Sz on USG (SYS III/V)
                systems uses XON/XOFF flow control. If flow
                control cannot be properly set up, Try a &quot;-w
                2048&quot; option to enforce protocol level flow
                control. Experiment with different window sizes
                for best results.<p>If a program that does not
                properly implement the specified file transfer
                protocol causes sb to &quot;hang&quot; the port
                after a failed transfer, either wait for sb to
                time out or type a dozen Ctrl-X characters.</p>
                <p>Many programs claiming to support YMODEM only
                support XMODEM with 1k blocks, and they often
                don't get that quite right. XMODEM transfers add
                up to 127 garbage bytes per file. XMODEM-1k and
                YMODEM-1k transfers use 128 byte blocks to avoid
                extra padding.</p>
                <p>YMODEM programs use the file length
                transmitted at the beginning of the transfer to
                prune the file to the correct length; this may
                cause problems with source files that grow during
                the course of the transfer. This problem does not
                pertain to ZMODEM transfers, which preserve the
                exact file length unconditionally.</p>
                <p>Most ZMODEM options are merely passed to the
                receiving program; some programs do not implement
                all of these options.</p>
                <p>Circular buffering and a ZMODEM sliding window
                should be used when input is from pipes instead
                of acknowledging frames each 1024 bytes. If no
                files can be opened, sz sends a ZMODEM command to
                echo a suitable complaint; perhaps it should
                check for the presence of at least one accessible
                file before getting hot and bothered.</p>

<p><b>BUGS</b></p>

<dir>
    <li><dir>
            <li>On at least one BSD system, sz would abnormally
                end if it got within a few kilobytes of the end
                of file. Using the &quot;-w 8192&quot; flag fixed
                the problem. The real cause is unknown, perhaps a
                bug in the kernel TTY output routines.<p>The test
                mode leaves a zero length file on the receiving

<p><b>GNO/ME</b></p>

<dir>
    <li><dir>
            <li>The usual manner of invoking sz to send files
                from a IIgs is as follows:<p>Connect to the other
                computer with a term program such as TelCom GS</p>
                <p>Start the X/Y/Zmodem receive on the other side</p>

                <p>You may put this operation in the background
                of course. Tests have shown no data loss up to
                9600 baud in background operation.</p>
                <p>The -b option ensures binary mode. You must
                use this if you're sending a ShrinkIt archive or
                other binary file. For plain text files you can
                leave off the -b.</p>

<p><b>DESCRIPTION</b></p>

<dir>
    <li><dir>
            <li><b>tar</b> lists the contents of and extracts
                files from UNIX tape archives (*.tar files).<p>Traditionally,
                <b>tar</b> does not require the normal '-'
                character to denote its arguments. The option
                flags are as follows:</p>
                <p>-<i>x</i> Extract files from the archive</p>
                <p>-<i>v</i> Verbose mode (tell what tar is
                doing)</p>
                <p>-<i>t</i> Tell mode (list files in archive)</p>
                <p>-<i>f</i> Use a file on disk instead of a tape</p>
                <p>Since the standard IIGS filesystem is not as
                flexible, filename-wise, as UNIX filesystems,
                some pre-processing is performed on filenames
                created when an archive is extracted.</p>
                <p>&#149; If a tar filename contains a double-/
                (possible under UNIX if an archive was created by
                specifying a directory with a trailing slash),
                tar converts it to a single /.</p>
                <p>&#149; If a filename contains non-alpha
                numeric characters, they are converted to periods
                ('.').</p>
                <p><b>tar</b> does not maintain the file
                protection bits from UNIX, nor does it maintain
                the creation and modification dates.</p>

    <li>purge - deallocate purgeable memory handles</li>
</dir>

<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b></p>

<dir>
    <li><b>purge</b> [-v]</li>
</dir>

<p><b>DESCRIPTION</b></p>

<dir>
    <li>This program purges all memory blocks marked purgable.
        This is very important when using the Orca compilers and
        shells since certain blocks get left lying around and can
        (and have!) caused compiler errors. By purging memory
        before compiles a large percentage of strange compiler
        errors can be eliminated. After purging, all memory
        possible is then freed for usage.<p>-v gives a verbose
        listing of each handle being purged and before and after
        free memory statistics.</p>
        <p>The problems mentioned above usually occur when a
        program has over-written one of the ORCA FastFile
        system's memory handles. Purging clears these handles and
        forces a reload from disk.</p>
    </li>
</dir>

<p><b>BUGS</b></p>

<dir>
    <li>Purging memory when non-shell applications are running
        could be dangerous.</li>

<p><b>DESCRIPTION</b></p>

<dir>
    <li>This program uses error correcting protocols to receive
        files over a dial-in serial port from a variety of
        programs running under many operating systems. It is
        invoked from a shell prompt manually, or automatically as
        a result of an &quot;<b>sz</b> file ...&quot; command
        given to the calling program.<p>This is a shareware
        program copyrighted by Omen Technology INC.</p>
        <p><b>Rz</b> (Receive ZMODEM) receives one or more files
        with the ZMODEM protocol. Pathnames are supplied by the
        sending program, and directories are made if necessary
        (and possible). Normally, the &quot;<b>rz</b>&quot;
        command is automatically issued by the calling ZMODEM
        program, but defective ZMODEM implementations may require
        starting <b>rz</b> manually.</p>
        <p><b>Rb</b> receives file(s) with YMODEM, accepting
        either standard128 byte sectors or 1024 byte sectors (sb <b>-k</b>
        option). The user should determine when the 1024 byte
        block length actually improves throughput.</p>
        <p>If True YMODEM&trade; (Omen Technology trademark) file
        information (file length, etc.) is received, the file
        length controls the number of bytes written to the output
        dataset, and the modify time and file mode (iff non zero)
        are set accordingly.</p>
        <p>If True YMODEM file information is not received,
        slashes in the pathname are changed to underscore, and
        any trailing period in the pathname is eliminated. This
        conversion is useful for files received from CP/M and
        other historical systems.</p>
        <p><b>Rc</b> receives a single <u>file</u> with
        XMODEM-CRC or XMODEM-1k-CRC protocol. The user should
        determine when the 1024 byte block length actually
        improves throughput without causing problems. The user
        must supply the file name to both sending and receiving
        programs. Up to 1023 garbage characters may be added to
        the received file.</p>
        <p><b>Rx</b> receives a single <u>file</u> with XMODEM or
        XMODEM-1k protocol. The user should determine when the
        1024 byte block length actually improves throughput
        without causing problems. The user must supply the file
        name to both sending and receiving programs. Up to 1023
        garbage characters may be added to the received file.</p>
        <p><b>Rz</b> may be invoked as <b>rzCOMMAND</b> (with an
        optional leading - as generated by login(1)). For each
        received file, <u>rz</u> will pipe the file to ``COMMAND
        filename'' where filename is the name of the transmitted
        file with the file contents as standard input.</p>
        <p>Each file transfer is acknowledged when COMMAND exits
        with 0 status. A non zero exit status terminates
        transfers.</p>
        <p>A typical use for this form is <u>rzmail</u> which
        calls rmail(1) to post mail to the user specified by the
        transmitted file name. For example, sending the file
        &quot;caf&quot; from a PC-DOS system to <u>rzmail</u> on
        a Unix system would result in the contents of the DOS
        file &quot;caf&quot; being mailed to user
        &quot;caf&quot;.</p>
        <p>The meanings of the available options are:</p>
        <p><b>tim</b> Change timeout to <u>tim</u> tenths of
        seconds.</p>
        <p><b>v </b>Verbose causes a list of file names to be
        appended to /tmp/rzlog . More v's generate more detailed
        debugging output.</p>
    </li>
</dir>

<p><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></p>

<dir>
    <li>Exit status is as follows: 0 for successful transfers. 1
        if unrecoverable errors are detected. 2 if syntax errors
        or file access problems are detected. 3 if the program
        was terminated by a caught interrupt.</li>

<p><b>NOTES</b></p>

<dir>
    <li>ZMODEM's support of XOFF/XON flow control allows proper
        operation in many environments that do not support XMODEM
        uploads. Unfortunately, not all Unix versions support
        input flow control. The TTY input buffering on some
        systems may not adequately buffer long blocks or
        streaming input at high speed. You should suspect this
        problem when you can't send data to the Unix system at
        high speeds using ZMODEM, YMODEM-1k or XMODEM-1k, but
        YMODEM with 128 byte blocks works properly.<p>If a
        program that does not properly implement the specified
        file transfer protocol causes <b>rz</b> to
        &quot;hang&quot; the port after a failed transfer, either
        wait for <b>rz</b> to time out or keyboard a dozen Ctrl-X
        characters.</p>
        <p>Many programs claiming to support YMODEM only support
        XMODEM with 1k blocks, and they often don't get that
        quite right.</p>
    </li>

<p><b>BUGS</b></p>

<dir>
    <li>This version of <b>rz</b> does not support some ZMODEM
        features.<p>The ASCII option's CR/LF to NL translation
        merely deletes CR's.</p>
    </li>
</dir>

<p><b>ZMODEM CAPABILITIES</b></p>

    </li>
</dir>

<p><b>DESCRIPTION</b></p>

<dir>
    <li><b>Sz</b> (send ZMODEM) uses the ZMODEM, YMODEM or XMODEM
        error correcting protocol to send one or more files over
        a dial-in serial port to a variety of programs running
        under PC-DOS, CP/M, Unix, VMS, and other operating
        systems.<p>This is a shareware program copyrighted by
        Omen Technology INC.</p>
        <p><b>Sz</b> sends one or more files with ZMODEM
        protocol.</p>
        <p>ZMODEM greatly simplifies file transfers compared to
        XMODEM. In addition to a friendly user interface, ZMODEM
        provides Personal Computer and other users an efficient,
        accurate, and robust file transfer method.</p>
        <p>ZMODEM provides complete END-TO-END data integrity
        between application programs. ZMODEM's 32 bit CRC catches
        errors that sneak into even the most advanced networks.</p>
        <p>Advanced file management features include AutoDownload
        (Automatic file Download initiated without user
        intervention), Display of individual and total file
        lengths and transmission time estimates, Crash Recovery,
        selective file transfers, and preservation of exact file
        date and length.</p>
        <p>The -y option instructs the receiver to open the file
        for writing unconditionally. The -a option causes the
        receiver to convert Unix newlines to PC-DOS carriage
        returns and linefeeds.</p>
        <p><b>Sb</b> sends one or more files with YMODEM or
        ZMODEM protocol. The initial ZMODEM initialization is not
        sent. When requested by the receiver, <b>sb</b> supports
        YMODEM-g with &quot;cbreak&quot; tty mode, XON/XOFF flow
        control, and interrupt character set to CAN (^X).
        YMODEM-g increases YMODEM throughput over error free
        channels (direct connection, X.PC, etc.) by disabling
        error recovery.</p>
        <p>On Unix systems, additional information about the file
        is transmitted. If the receiving program uses this
        information, the transmitted file length controls the
        exact number of bytes written to the output dataset, and
        the modify time and file mode are set accordingly.</p>
        <p><b>Sx</b> sends a single file with XMODEM or XMODEM-1k
        protocol (sometimes incorrectly called
        &quot;ymodem&quot;). The user must supply the file name
        to both sending and receiving programs.</p>
        <p>If <b>sz</b> is invoked with $SHELL set and if that
        variable contains the string rsh or rksh (restricted
        shell), sz operates in restricted mode. Restricted mode
        restricts pathnames to the current directory and PUBDIR
        (usually /usr/spool/uucppublic) and/or subdirectories
        thereof.</p>
        <p>The fourth form sends a single COMMAND to a ZMODEM
        receiver for execution. Zcommand exits with the COMMAND
        return value. If COMMAND includes spaces or characters
        special to the shell, it must be quoted.</p>
        <p>The fifth form sends a single COMMAND to a ZMODEM
        receiver for execution. Zcommandi exits as soon as the
        receiver has correctly received the command, before it is
        executed.</p>
        <p>The sixth form (sz -TT) attempts to output all 256
        code combinations to the terminal. If you are having
        difficulty sending files, this command lets you see which
        character codes are being eaten by the operating system.</p>
        <p>The meanings of the available options are:</p>
        <p><i>+</i> Instruct the receiver to append transmitted
        data to an existing file (ZMODEM only).</p>
        <p><i>a</i> Instruct the ZMODEM receiver to convert text
        file format as appropriate for the receiving system.
        Valid only for ZMODEM.</p>
        <p><i>b</i> (Zmodem) Binary override: transfer file
        without any translation.</p>
        <p><i>c</i> Instruct the receiver to change the pathname
        if the destination file exists.</p>
        <p><i>d</i> Change all instances of &quot;.&quot; to
        &quot;/&quot; in the transmitted pathname. Thus,
        C.omenB0000 (which is unacceptable to MSDOS or CP/M) is
        transmitted as C/omenB0000. If the resultant filename has
        more than 8 characters in the stem, a &quot;.&quot; is
        inserted to allow a total of eleven.</p>
        <p><i>e</i> Escape all control characters; normally only
        XON, XOFF, DLE, CR-@-CR, and Ctrl-X are escaped.</p>
        <p><i>f</i> Send Full pathname. Normally directory
        prefixes are stripped from the transmitted filename.</p>
        <p><i>k</i> (X/Ymodem) Send files using 1024 byte blocks
        rather than the default 128 byte blocks. 1024 byte
        packets speed file transfers at high bit rates. (ZMODEM
        streams the data for the best possible throughput.)</p>
        <p><i>L N</i> Use ZMODEM sub-packets of length N. A
        larger N (32 &lt;= N &lt;= 1024) gives slightly higher
        hroughput, a smaller N speeds error recovery. The default
        is 128 below 300 baud, 256 above 300 baud, or 1024 above
        2400 baud.</p>
        <p><i>l N</i> Wait for the receiver to acknowledge
        correct data every N (32 &lt;= N &lt;= 1024) characters.
        This may be used to avoid network overrun when XOFF flow
        control is lacking.</p>
        <p><i>n</i> (Zmodem) Send each file if destination file
        does not exist. Overwrite destination file if source file
        is newer than the destination file.</p>
        <p><i>N</i> (Zmodem) Send each file if destination file
        does not exist. Overwrite destination file if source file
        is newer or longer than the destination file.</p>
        <p><i>o</i> (Zmodem) Disable automatic selection of 32
        bit CRC.</p>
        <p><i>p</i> (Zmodem) Protect existing destination files
        by skipping transfer if the destination file exists.</p>
        <p><i>r</i> (Zmodem) Resume interrupted file transfer. If
        the source file is longer than the destination file, the
        transfer commences at the offset in the source file that
        equals the length of the destination file.</p>
        <p><i>rr </i>As above, but compares the files (the
        portion common to sender and reciever) before resuming
        the transfer.</p>
        <p><i>t</i> tim Change timeout to tim tenths of seconds.</p>
        <p><i>u</i> Unlink the file after successful
        transmission.</p>
        <p><i>w</i> N Limit the transmit window size to N bytes
        (ZMODEM).</p>
        <p><i>v</i> Verbose causes a list of file names to be
        appended to /tmp/szlog. More v's generate more output.</p>
        <p><i>y</i> Instruct a ZMODEM receiving program to
        overwrite any existing file with the same name.</p>
        <p><i>Y</i> Instruct a ZMODEM receiving program to
        overwrite any existing file with the same name, and to
        skip any source files that do have a file with the same
        pathname on the destination system.</p>
        <p><i>Z</i> Use ZMODEM file compression to speed file
        transfer.</p>

        if unrecoverable errors are detected. 2 if syntax errors
        or file access problems are detected. 3 if the program
        was terminated by a caught interrupt.</li>

<p><b>EXAMPLE</b></p>

<dir>
    <li><u>ZMODEM File Transfer (GNO to remote system)</u><p><font
        face="Courier New">% sz -a *.c</font></p>
        <p>This single command transfers all .c files in the
        current directory with conversion (-a) to end of line
        conventions appropriate to the receiving environment.
        With ZMODEM AutoDownload enabled, will automatically
        recieve the files after performing a security check.</p>
        <p><font face="Courier New">% sz -Yan *.c *.h</font></p>
        <p>Send only the .c and .h files that exist on both
        systems, and are newer on the sending system than the
        corresponding version on the receiving system, converting
        Apple to UNIX text format.</p>

<p><b>TESTING FEATURE</b></p>

<dir>
    <li>The command &quot;sz -T file&quot; exercises the Attn
        sequence error recovery by commanding errors with
        unterminated packets. The receiving program should
        complain five times about binary data packets being too
        long. Each time sz is interrupted, it should send a ZDATA
        header followed by another defective packet. If the
        receiver does not detect five long data packets, the Attn
        sequence is not interrupting the sender, and the Myattn
        string in sz.c must be modified.<p>After 5 packets, sz
        stops the &quot;transfer&quot; and prints the total
        number of characters &quot;sent&quot; (Tcount). The
        difference between Tcount and 5120 represents the number
        of characters stored in various buffers when the Attn
        sequence is generated.</p>
    </li>

<p><b>NOTES</b></p>

<dir>
    <li>When using buffered modems at high speed, particular
        attention must be paid to flow control. The modem and
        Unix must agree on the flow control method. Sz on USG
        (SYS III/V) systems uses XON/XOFF flow control. If flow
        control cannot be properly set up, Try a &quot;-w
        2048&quot; option to enforce protocol level flow control.
        Experiment with different window sizes for best results.<p>If
        a program that does not properly implement the specified
        file transfer protocol causes sb to &quot;hang&quot; the
        port after a failed transfer, either wait for sb to time
        out or type a dozen Ctrl-X characters.</p>
        <p>Many programs claiming to support YMODEM only support
        XMODEM with 1k blocks, and they often don't get that
        quite right. XMODEM transfers add up to 127 garbage bytes
        per file. XMODEM-1k and YMODEM-1k transfers use 128 byte
        blocks to avoid extra padding.</p>
        <p>YMODEM programs use the file length transmitted at the
        beginning of the transfer to prune the file to the
        correct length; this may cause problems with source files
        that grow during the course of the transfer. This problem
        does not pertain to ZMODEM transfers, which preserve the
        exact file length unconditionally.</p>
        <p>Most ZMODEM options are merely passed to the receiving
        program; some programs do not implement all of these
        options.</p>
        <p>Circular buffering and a ZMODEM sliding window should
        be used when input is from pipes instead of acknowledging
        frames each 1024 bytes. If no files can be opened, sz
        sends a ZMODEM command to echo a suitable complaint;
        perhaps it should check for the presence of at least one
        accessible file before getting hot and bothered.</p>

<p><b>BUGS</b></p>

<dir>
    <li>On at least one BSD system, sz would abnormally end if it
        got within a few kilobytes of the end of file. Using the
        &quot;-w 8192&quot; flag fixed the problem. The real
        cause is unknown, perhaps a bug in the kernel TTY output
        routines.<p>The test mode leaves a zero length file on
        the receiving system.</p>
    </li>
</dir>

<p><b>GNO/ME</b></p>

<dir>
    <li>The usual manner of invoking sz to send files from a IIgs
        is as follows:<p>Connect to the other computer with a
        term program such as TelCom GS</p>
        <p>Start the X/Y/Zmodem receive on the other side</p>
        <p>Get/Quit back to the GNO Shell</p>
        <p>Type:</p>
        <p><font face="Courier New">sz -v -v -b filename1
        filename2 .. &lt;.ttya &gt;.ttyb</font></p>
        <p>You may put this operation in the background of
        course. Tests have shown no data loss up to 9600 baud in
        background operation.</p>
        <p>The -b option ensures binary mode. You must use this
        if you're sending a ShrinkIt archive or other binary
        file. For plain text files you can leave off the -b.</p>

<p><b>NAME</b></p>

<dir>
    <li>tar - extract and view tape archives</li>
</dir>

<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b></p>

<dir>
    <li><b>tar</b> [-]{<i>x</i>|<i>t</i>}f[<i>v</i>] <i>archive</i></li>
</dir>

<p><b>DESCRIPTION</b></p>

<dir>
    <li><b>tar</b> lists the contents of and extracts files from
        UNIX tape archives (*.tar files).<p>Traditionally, <b>tar</b>
        does not require the normal '-' character to denote its
        arguments. The option flags are as follows:</p>
        <p>-<i>x</i> Extract files from the archive</p>
        <p>-<i>v</i> Verbose mode (tell what tar is doing)</p>
        <p>-<i>t</i> Tell mode (list files in archive)</p>
        <p>-<i>f</i> Use a file on disk instead of a tape</p>
        <p>Since the standard IIGS filesystem is not as flexible,
        filename-wise, as UNIX filesystems, some pre-processing
        is performed on filenames created when an archive is
        extracted.</p>
        <p>&#149; If a tar filename contains a double-/ (possible
        under UNIX if an archive was created by specifying a
        directory with a trailing slash), tar converts it to a
        single /.</p>
        <p>&#149; If a filename contains non-alpha numeric
        characters, they are converted to periods ('.').</p>
        <p><b>tar</b> does not maintain the file protection bits
        from UNIX, nor does it maintain the creation and
        modification dates.</p>
    </li>
</dir>

<p><b>BUGS</b></p>

<dir>
    <li>Does not create .tar archives<p>Does not work with raw
        devices, only files</p>
        <p>Does not allow user to specify which files to extract
        from archive</p>
        <p>tar should use the GS/OS JudgeName call.</p>
        <p>The -x and -t options should be exclusive, but are
        not.</p>
