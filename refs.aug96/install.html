<p><font face="Times"><b>Reporting Bugs</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times">In any large piece of computer software
such as the GNO/ME system, bugs are sure to turn up, no matter
how much testing is performed on the software before it goes out
the door. If you discover a bug in GNO/ME, we'd like to hear
about it. There are several things we require, however, to make
bug reports useful to us.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">First of all, we need a complete
description of your computer system; how much RAM, what cards, in
what slots, what type of disk storage, etc. This information is
very important in tracking down hardware-dependent bugs. Also, we
need to know the version numbers of the software involved; the
GNO Kernel, the GNO Shell, and any utilities.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">Second, we need a step-by-step description
of how to duplicate the bug. If this requires writing down
individual keystrokes, then we need it. Only in this way can we
decide whether the bug is hardware dependent or global.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">You can send bug reports to any of the
electronic mail addresses listed on the 'Credits' page, or by
mailing a disk containing a description of the problem and the
necessary software and files to the Procyon address.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times"><b>User Projects</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times">If you're working on a project which
utilizes GNO/ME in some way, we'd like to know about it. Just
contact us by mail, phone, or whatever is most convenient for
you, and tell us about your project. If possible, we'll
coordinate your efforts with those of other programmers. If we
really like your project and think it may be useful to others, we
may include it on the next GNO/ME distribution!</font></p>

<p><font face="Times"><b>Software Piracy</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times">If you copied GNO/ME from someone and are
now reading this, take a moment to reflect on what you've done.
GNO/ME is a project that has consumed around three man-years of
effort, huge amounts of money, and a lot of grief on our part.
The kernel alone consists of over 18,000 lines of source code;
the shell and utilities make up another twenty to thirty thousand
lines.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">Is it right that you're now benefiting from
our effort without any just compensation to the authors and
Procyon, Inc.? We are Apple II programmers born, bred and raised
in the spirit of the machine; we love to program it, and probably
always will. But if we cannot make enough money to make it
worthwhile to continue work on GNO/ME, then we won't; because by
worthwhile, we mean not only food on the table, but resources for
expansion; expansion of our IIgs product line and support to IIgs
owners being abandoned by the rest of the industry. In short,
support us and we'll support you.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">GNO/ME is very inexpensive when you
consider what it allows you to do, and what it will allow you to
do when software development for GNO/ME starts full-swing. And
it's a small price to pay indeed for our loyalty to you, the IIgs
owner.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">To all you GNO/ME purchasers out there:
thank you very much. We will continue to provide you with new
IIgs products until our hair and teeth fall out, and our fingers
are too frail to type the keys (and even then, with Easy Access,
we might crank out a program or two). We hope you will be
sufficiently impressed with the system to recommend it to others.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">p.s. Remember - if someone comes up to you
on the street and offers you some IBM, <b>Just Say GNO!</b></font></p>

<hr>

<p><font size="6" face="Times">Preface</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">Computers are tools. The flexibility of a
tool determines how useful it is. Early computers were much like
the one this software was written for: the Apple IIgs. They could
only run one program at a time, and their usefulness was limited
to what the particular program the user was executing offered. In
the late 1960's, a team of researchers at AT&amp;T began
developing the UNIX operating system. The UNIX design was
partially based on the premise that most programs are I/O bound,
that is, most of the time the program executes is spent waiting
for user input or other I/O operations. While one program is
waiting for I/O, why not allow another program to execute? This
is what they did, and the result was one of the most successful
computer operating systems ever created.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">The Apple IIgs, like the Macintosh it is
modelled after, provides very limited multitasking abilities in
the form of desk accessories (NDAs). The programs in the NDA menu
are available in whatever application you use as long as it
follows Apple's guidelines. However, there are many graphics
based programs that don't support NDAs, and in addition there is
a wealth of software that has been developed for the Byte Works'
ORCA environment. This environment is mainly text-based, and thus
makes access to NDAs impossible. As if that wasn't enough, it's
very difficult to write an NDA to allow the application to keep
running concurrently. So the benefits are lost, and we're back at
ground zero.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">Enter the GNO Multitasking Environment.
What was once just dreamed about is now a reality. GNO/ME
provides an environment that is almost entirely compatible with
software developed for the ORCA environment. But GNO/ME also
provides a wealth of new abilities, lots of new ground for
developers and users alike.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">Before we begin describing, we'd like to
respond to those who say such a multitasking system isn't
possible on the Apple IIgs. Obviously it is: you hold it in your
hands. Some say the Apple IIgs isn't powerful enough to make
multitasking useful. We point out that the Apple IIgs is much
more powerful than the first computers UNIX was designed to run
on; they only had 64K of real memory, and were 16 bit machines.
Some ask why you'd ever need to run more than one program at
once. These are the same people who asked why we'd ever need more
than 64K of memory, or more than 140K of storage on disks (end
soapbox).</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font size="6" face="Times">Introduction</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">The GNO Multitasking Environment provides
pre-emptive multitasking. Many programs can be executing at the
same time; each is called a 'process'. Each process is allowed to
run for a short period of time (1/20th of a second on average).
When its time runs out, the current process is set aside and
another one chosen to run next. This cycle continues until there
are no more processes left (i.e. when you exit GNO/ME). Starting
up processes to run 'in the background' is a simple matter of
adding a few characters to the shell commands.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">GNO/ME provides a shell that takes full
advantage of the multitasking ability provided. The most
important feature of the shell is job control (starting,
terminating, and suspending processes). But the shell also
provides power never before seen on the Apple IIgs. The ability
to choose files by 'wildcard' has been around for a while, but
the GNO Shell takes this to a new level with 'regular
expressions', a very powerful yet simple programming language.
Other benefits of the GNO shell are too numerous to mention. (see
the <i>GNO Shell User's Manual </i>for details).</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">In addition to being compatible with the
ORCA system, GNO/ME is a very powerful programming environment.
Available to the programmer are all the calls needed to control
processes, support Inter-Process Communication, and other tools
needed in a multitasking environment. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times">GNO/ME also boasts the first completely
consistent method for accessing serial and console I/O. The IIgs
TextTools have been incredibly enhanced to provide a truly
all-encompassing interface for serial, console, and IPC
applications. Imagine being able to attach terminals to your GS,
and have a useful shell in each one. Multiuser BBSs, remote
dial-ups, UUCP or SLIP that doesn't take over your computer- the
applications are endless!</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">With all this talk of shell utilities, have
desktop users (users of programs like AppleWorks GS) been left
behind? Absolutely not. GNO/ME doesn't allow more than one
desktop program to run concurrently, but it DOES let you run a
desktop program with as many text applications as you like. In
other words, no functionality is lost from the IIgs by using
GNO/ME.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">Finally, the GNO Multitasking Environment
comes with a large number of free utilities that bring some of
the power of a UNIX system to the Apple IIgs. Also, a number of
programming libraries are included that make it easy to port
programs from UNIX or MS-DOS systems to the Apple IIgs.</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font size="6" face="Times">The GNO/ME package</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">Included in your GNO/ME Version 2.0 package
are:</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Times">this GNO/ME overview </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times">the GNO Shell User's Manual</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times">the GNO Kernel Reference Manual</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times">a selection of utility and library
        documentation</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times">a reading list containing a wide
        selection of books for both the user and the programmer</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times">three disks containing the GNO Kernel,
        GNO Shell, and loads of utilities</font></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p><font size="6" face="Times">Hardware Requirements</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">GNO/ME will work on any Apple IIgs with at
least 2 MegaBytes of memory and a hard drive.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">You should have at least 5 MegaBytes of
hard disk space free.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">We recommend 4 MegaBytes of Memory and an
accellerator card, especially if you will be using GNO with many
background processes. A modem and access to an on-line service
will greatly speed access to technical assistance and new
utilities as they are made available.</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font size="6" face="Times">Installation</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">GNO/ME is a very large system. Most of the
system is stored on the three disks in a compressed format. For
this reason we recommend that you read this section carefully and
use the included automated installation program to save yourself
the major headache of arranging everything. You'll need a hard
drive partition with at least 5 Megabytes free to install GNO/ME.
The entire installation process should take no longer than 10
minutes. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times">If you are upgrading from GNO 1.0 to GNO
2.0, we recommend that you install GNO 2.0 on a new area of your
hard drive. This is because GNO 2.0 provides new versions of
almost all the utilities and other software provided with GNO
1.0. You can then move the parts of your old system that aren't a
part of the standard GNO 2.0 distribution over to the new
installation. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times">The installer program is able to the copy
the GNO libraries for use with the ORCA languages and tools. If
you want to use your ORCA languages and tools, you should answer
the appropriate questions during the install process. ORCA
installation is covered in more detail below.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">Step 1:</font></p>

<dir>
    <li><font face="Times">Copy the contents of /GNO.Disk1 to the
        partition where you want to install GNO/ME. The easiest
        way to do this is to run the IIGS Finder&trade; program,
        insert the </font><font size="2" face="Courier">/GNO.Disk1</font><font
        face="Times"> disk, and drag the </font><font size="2"
        face="Courier">/GNO.Disk1</font><font face="Times"> onto
        the icon of the drive you want to install on. The Finder
        will tell you that the disks are of a different size, and
        ask you if you wish to place the contents of </font><font
        size="2" face="Courier">/GNO.Disk1</font><font
        face="Times"> in a folder on the hard drive partition.
        Answer &quot;Yes&quot;, and the Finder will copy the
        data.</font></li>
</dir>

<p><font face="Times">Step 2:</font></p>

<dir>
    <li><font face="Times">Open the newly created </font><font
        size="2" face="Courier">GNO.Disk1</font><font
        face="Times"> folder on the partition and execute 'Kern'
        by double-clicking on the </font><font size="2"
        face="Courier">Kern</font><font face="Times"> icon. </font><font
        size="2" face="Times">GNO.Disk1</font><font face="Times">
        contains a minimal GNO system which you have just started
        up. You'll see some copyright messages, and after a few
        seconds the desktop will appear.</font></li>
</dir>

<p><font face="Times">Step 3:</font></p>

<dir>
    <li><font face="Times">Install will ask you questions before
        the installation process begins. Questions asked by
        Install are boldfaced in the following discussion. If
        you're uncertain of how to answer, click on the 'Info'
        button to get more information on the question. This
        information is reproduced here for ease of reference.</font><p><font
        face="Times"><b>Do you have existing Byteworks (ORCA)
        language products?</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times">If you use Byteworks language
        products such as ORCA/C, ORCA/M, ORCA/Pascal, etc. and
        wish to use them from GNO/ME then answer 'Yes' to this
        question. Otherwise, answer 'No'.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times">Clicking on the 'Info' button will
        display the following text:</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Geneva,Arial">If you currently
        use products such as ORCA/C, ORCA/Pascal, ORCA/M, etc.,
        and wish to use them from GNO/ME then you should answer
        'Yes' to this dialog.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Geneva,Arial">Install will then
        ask you to locate the file &quot;ORCA.SYS16&quot; (the
        ORCA Shell). Usually, it will be in a directory called
        &quot;ORCA&quot; on one of your hard drive partitions. On
        our system, it is :software:orca. The location of this
        file determines where Install puts the GNO-specific
        ORCA/C header files and libraries (in the ORCA LIBRARIES
        directory). If you have renamed ORCA.SYS16 to something
        else, select that instead. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Geneva,Arial">Install uses this
        information to correctly set the ORCA prefixes and add
        the EXECUTABLES directory to the $PATH variable in your
        gshrc file. See the GNO Shell User's Manual, Appendix B,
        for more information on the ORCA prefixes.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times"><b>Do you want to install the
        modified ORCA/C 2.0 ORCALIB library?</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times">If you have ORCA/C 2.0 installed
        and you answered 'Yes' to the previous question, then you
        should answer 'Yes' now. If you have ORCA/C 1.3
        installed, or you do not have any ORCA languages or
        tools, then you should answer 'No'.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times">Clicking 'Info' will display the
        following text:</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Geneva,Arial">GNO/ME 2.0 comes
        with a modified version of the ORCA/C ORCALIB standard
        library. This library adds specific support for some of
        GNO's special files (pipes, terminals, etc) transparently
        and corrects other problems the standard ORCALIB has with
        GNO.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Geneva,Arial">This special
        ORCALIB is only for use with ORCA/C 2.0. It will NOT work
        with previous versions of ORCA/C.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Geneva,Arial">Note that all of
        GNO's other libraries (libgno, libbsd, libc) work fine
        with ORCA/C 1.3.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times"><b>Do you want to install the
        Multi-User package?</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times">If you wish to have the Multi User
        package installed, answer 'Yes'. It is recommended that
        new users do not install this package until they are
        familiar with the system. This package is not fully
        discussed in the GNO/ME manuals and may introduce many
        unfamiliar concepts.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times">Clicking 'Info' will display the
        following text:</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Geneva,Arial">The 'Multi-User'
        package consists of a number of cooperating programs,
        including init(8) and login(8). MU provides for
        password-protected access to the GNO Shell via the
        console or serial ports (modems and dedicated terminals).
        It also handles multiple user accounts, and a certain
        level of protection between users. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Geneva,Arial">If you will be
        using a terminal with GNO, or want to be able to dial
        into GNO with a modem, you should install MU.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Geneva,Arial">You may wish to
        hold off setting up the Multi-User package until you
        learn your way around GNO a little better, as it's simple
        to set up MU later.</font></p>
    </li>
</dir>

<p><font face="Times">Step 4:</font></p>

<dir>
    <li><font face="Times">The Installer will now proceed to
        arrange the GNO Multitasking Environment on your hard
        drive. Initially, the contents of /GNO.Disk1 will be
        moved into the proper places on the volume you have
        chosen. When asked by the Installer, you should place
        /GNO.Disk2 and /GNO.Disk3 into the disk drive. The
        contents of these disks will be extracted and
        decompressed into their proper places.</font><p><font
        face="Times">If the installer cannot finish it's tasks
        for some reason, it will abort to the shell. At this
        point you should study the error messages to determine
        the cause of the failure, </font></p>

<p><font face="Times">That's all!</font></p>

<p><font face="Times"><b>What has been installed?</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times">If you examine the directory that you chose
for GNO/ME, you will find that the Installer has created several
directories. Here is a brief rundown of thier contents:</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<dir>
    <li><font face="Times">:gno:bin: This directory contains the
        executable shell utilities included with the GNO/ME
        package.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times">gno:dev: This directory contains
        device drivers. The GNO/ME package includes serial
        drivers for the II</font><font size="2" face="Times">GS</font><font
        face="Times">' built-in modem and printer ports.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times">:gno:etc: Various system configuration
        files</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times">:gno:initrc This a startup file for
        kern and must remain in this directory.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times">:gno:kern This is the GNO kernel.
        Launch this to start GNO/ME.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times">:gno:lib: This directory is provided
        for,,,, It is currently empty.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times">:gno:tmp: This directory is provided
        for,,,, It is currently empty.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times">:gno:user: This directory is created
        if you installed the Multi-User package. It contains a
        user directories for users of the system. Currently there
        is only one: 'root'. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times">:gno:usr: This directory contains UNIX
        System Resources (USR).</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times">:gno:usr:bin: Miscellaneous utilities</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times">:gno:usr:man: This directory contains
        the manual pages for the 'man' utility. There are eight
        categories of information as defined by UNIX standards.
        These eight categories are presented in either formatted
        (man) or unformatted (cat) entries.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times">:gno:usr:games: The classic &quot;Hunt
        the Wumpus&quot; game, and perhaps others.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times">:gno:usr:sbin: System administration
        utilities.</font></li>
</dir>

<p><font size="6" face="Times">Desk Accessories</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">The following is a description of the desk
accessories that are shipped with GNO/ME.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times"><b>GSI NDA</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times">The Graphical Shell Interface New Desk
Accessory allows you to access the shell from a window inside a
desktop application. Selecting 'GSI' from the Apple menu opens a
window and brings up a shell in it. You can use the shell in this
window just as you would in text mode.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">At this time, GSI doesn't support any
terminal emulations; i.e., it's a 'dumb' interface. As a result,
full screen programs like 'less' and 'vi' will not work properly
in GSI.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times"><b>Suspend NDA</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times">The Suspend New Desk Accessory allows you
to temporarily stop a desktop program and return to the text
shell. To return to the desktop program, simply type '<b>fg</b>'.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">You may put desktop programs in the
background ('<b>bg</b>') at your own risk. This is not guaranteed
to work for all programs, and putting a desktop program in the
background will not put the Apple IIgs in text mode.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">Also, do not run another desktop program
when one is currently suspended. The GNO kernel tries to cleanly
terminate the second program, but may not always be able to
accomplish this.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times"><b>GNO Snooper CDA</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times">The GNO Snooper CDA is a utility that is
very helpful in debugging software, and reporting system crashes.
Snooper has access to information inside the kernel that is not
generally available to processes.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">When you enter the control panel and choose
&quot;GNO Snooper&quot; a process list is displayed, which is
very similar to the 'ps' shell command, and a menu is presented
with the following options:</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">D)etails</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">Get detailed information on a process.
Snooper asks you for the process ID number of the process you
want to investigate. Snooper then dumps the state of the 65816
registers and shows various other information about the process.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">K)ill</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">This option sends a SIGKILL (signal number
9) to a process. Just type in the process ID of the process you
want to kill.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">P)rocess Group Dump</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">Dumps the system process group tables,
which is very useful for debugging code which manipulates process
groups. The first table, 'pgrp', is the process group reference
count table. This table lists how many processes (and TTYs)
belong to that process group. pgrp ID's start at 2, so the first
pgrp listed is 2.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">The second listing is the ttyStruct table.
This table shows which pgrp each TTY belongs to. The TTYs start
with .null (0), then move on to .ttyb, .ttya, .ttyco, etc.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">F)ile Table Dump</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">Lists all open files that GNO knows about.
The information is presented in tuples. The first element is the
real GS/OS refNum or device driver ID. The second is the type of
file (GSOS, ttyXX, or PIPE). The third is how many references to
that file are open. This information is global, so if two
processes have .NULL opened, the refcount for .tty00 will be 2.</font></p>
