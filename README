This is the documentation for GNO/ME (the GNO Multitasking Environment),
a UNIX-like environment for the Apple IIgs.  See <http://www.gno.org/gno>.

This documentation, which uses modern documentation frameworks, is not
built on an Apple IIgs due to the non-availability of those frameworks
on the IIgs, and the related computational power and memory requirements
for running those frameworks.

The canonical location for the sources you see here is the master git
repository at <https://github.com/GnoConsortium/gno-docs>.

If you are looking for man page sources, they are kept in the main
GNO/ME repository at <https://github.com/GnoConsortium/gno>.
