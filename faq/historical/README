The files in this directory were used when the comp.sys.apple2.gno
USENET news group was active.  That newsgroup has since been retired,
so these are no longer necessary.

In addition to these files, a program called auto-faq was used
for automated postings.  As of September 2012, auto-faq is available
at <http://www.novia.net/~pschleck/auto-faq/>
