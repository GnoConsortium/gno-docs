The following are instructions on how to build the documentation.

Platform:
	The canonical build platform is CentOS 5.x.  You are welcome
	to submit patches to allow the docs to build on other platforms,
	as long as you don't break the primary build.

	It has also been verified to build on the following platforms:
	       CentOS 5.8
	       RHEL 6.3

Required Tools:
	The following tool sets are available on the official build
	platform as part of the base distribution (that is, you can
	use yum(8) to install them).

	GNU make
	docbook2html	(CentOS package docbook-utils)
	docbook2pdf	(CentOS package docbook-utils-pdf)
	latex
	dvips
	dvipdfm
	latex2html

Preparation:

	Create the file etc/const-priv.mk.  See the comments in etc/const.mk
	for details. If you would like to override values set in const.mk,
	then create the file etc/const-local.mk.

Procedure:

	To build the documents, type:
	   make
	This will create a 'gen' subdirectory with all the documentation
	in it.

	On the official build server only, to install the documents, type:
	   make install

	You can clean up temporary files without affecting the built
	documents by doing a:
	   make clean

	You can do a complete cleanup, including built documents, via:
	   make clobber
