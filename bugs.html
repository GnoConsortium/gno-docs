<h2>GNO Bug Reports</h2>

<p>
If you wish to report a defect or suggest an enhancement, please
use the 
<a href="https://bugzilla.gno.org">GNO Bugzilla</a>.
</p>

<p>
Before you file a bug report, please ensure that it is actually
a defect in GNO.  The bug tracker is <em>NOT</em> a general support
mechanism, such as if you're having problems trying to figure out
how to do a particular task.
</p>

<p>
Second, having concluded that what you have is actually a bug (or
enhancement request), please
<a href="https://bugzilla.gno.org">search bugzilla</a>
to ensure that it has not already been reported (or suggested).
Note that <em>there is more than one product supported by
<b>bugzilla.gno.org</b></em>.  Ensure that you are filing
bugs under GNO itself and not one of the other products hosted
by the GNO Consortium.
</p>

<p>
Be aware that the GNO Bugzilla  uses self signed certificates.
If you're getting warnings from your browser about the certificates,
<a href="http://lists.gno.org/self-signed.html">help is available</a>
(just note that the site name is for <b>https://bugzilla.gno.org</b>
as opposed to <b>https://lists.gno.org</b>).

<h3>Writing an Effective Bug Report</h3>

<p>
For an excellent article on submitting bug or defect reports in
general (that is, for any software product), please see Simon
Tatham's
<a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html">
How to Report Bugs Effectively</a>.
</p>

<p>
For GNO in particular, please ensure that for bug reports you're
reporting at least the following information:
<ul>
<li>A summary of the problem.</li>
<li>A detailed description of the problem.</li>
<li>Instructions on how to produce the problem.</li>
<li>With which distribution did you observe the problem? If it is a released
    version, report the GNO version (eg: v2.0.6).  If it is with something
    that is based on current code you built from the source repository,
    report the version as &quot;current&quot;</li>
<li>Which component is affected?  The actual list is configured in
    bugzilla, however it will be something like the following:
	<ul>
	<li>Documentation
	<li>Utilities
	<li>The GNO Shell
	<li>The Kernel
	<li>Libraries and Header Files
	</ul>
    </li>
<li>If you are reporting a problem with a utility or library routine,
	include the name of the utility (or routine).  If it's available,
	also quote the version.  This is often given as an rVersion 
	resource on programs and libraries.</li>
<li>If your problem is with a library routine, give a <em>short</em>
	program which exhibits the problem.</li>
<li>You can attach supporting documents, source files, etc as attachments
    in bugzilla.</li>
</ul>
</p>
