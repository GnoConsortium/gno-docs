#
# Before this file is included, it is assumed that you have defined
# the following constants:
#
# SRCROOT	- The relative path to the base of the docs source
#                 (that is, the relative path of the directory above
#                 the etc directory in which this const.mk file resides).
#
# WEB_HOME_BASE - This is the directory, relative GNO_PUBLIC_HTML, where
#                 the files being built should reside upon installation.
#
# SUBPROJECTS	- The child directories into which the make should recurse.
#                 If the value is empty, then recursion will stop.
#
# In addition, also before this file is included, it is assumed that
# the including makefile will also have included the const-priv.mk file,
# also in this directory.  The const-priv.mk file is not checked into
# the repository, but is expected to be created locally and containing
# the following variables:
#
#   GNO_PUBLIC_HTML
#      The directory where the GNO web pages are anchored.  This
#      top level directory is not managed by these files, but
#      the files there need to reference these files.  If you are
#      not building this for the official GNO web site, you can
#      just point this at a scratch directory somewhere.
#
# After this file is included, the including makefile is expected to
# define

# This is the name and address that will be given as contact info
# at the bottom of each of the HTML pages.  Do NOT use '<' or '>' in the
# address.
