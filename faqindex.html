<h2>GNO Frequently Asked Questions (and Answers)</h2>

<p>
There used to be a news group, <b>comp.sys.apple2.gno</b>, to 
which there was a monthly FAQ posting.  That newsgroup is now
defunct, however the FAQ is still available.
</p>

<p>
It is available in two formats:
<a href="faq/csa2g.FAQ.html">HTML</a>, and
<a href="faq/csa2g.FAQ.txt">text</a>.
</p>

<p>
When the FAQ was still posted to <b>comp.sys.apple2.gno</b> there
was also a change log available.  Since the FAQ source is now 
available the GitHub source repository, that repository can be
used to determine the FAQ change history.
