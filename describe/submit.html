<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Making Submissions</H1>

If you have written a shell program for GNO or ORCA/Shell, please take a
minute and submit a describe entry.  If you don't know what a describe
entry looks like, see the
<A HREF="gno/man/man8/descc.8.html">descc</A>(8)
manual page or look at the describe database source file.  Alternately,
the file
<A HREF="pub/apple2/gs.specific/gno/doc/templates10.shk">
ftp://ftp.gno.org/pub/apple2/gs.specific/gno/doc/templates10.shk</A>
contains examples of describe entries plus other recommended methods of
documenting your programs.
<p>

There are two ways to submit a describe entry:
<ol>
<li>Use the <A HREF="gno/describe/submit.html#form">form</A>, below; or
<li>Email your entry or entries to
	<A HREF="mailto:describe-submit@trenco.gno.org">
	describe-submit@trenco.gno.org</A>.
<p>
	Since the recipient of this address is a filter, is is mandatory
	that your mail conform to the following conventions:
	<ul>
	<li>You must have the word &quot;describe&quot; somewhere in the
		subject line.  The case doesn't matter.
	<li>The body of your message may only contain one or more describe
		entries.  All field names (such as &quot;Name:&quot; and
		&quot;Shell:&quot;) must be at the start of a line.  The
		last (description) field is ended either at the end of the
		message, or when the next &quot;Name:&quot; field is found.
	<li>If your email software appends your .signature file, ensure
		that your signature is delimited from the body of the message
		in the standard fashion:  By two dash ('-') characters
		followed by a newline.  There newline may be preceeded by
		whitespace.
	<li>Do not use mailers which automaticly insert html formatting
		information outside of the message headers.
	</ul>
	If your email does not conform to these conventions, then it will
	be ignored by the filter.
</ol>
The master database may take a few days before it is updated, regardless
of which method you use.  This is because a human reviews the entries
before they are added to the database.  This check is done to avoid
abuse by malicious individuals.
<p>

We recommend that you actually include a describe entry in with your
program files.  (Describe files usually use the suffix &quot;.desc&quot).
That way, it is easier to remember to update your describe entry when
you update your program, and you only have to fill out the information 
once.
<p>

If you are updating a program that has been around for a while, you 
might want to check for an existing describe entry before making a 
submission.  Many programs have entries in the database even though
none are included in the sources.  (In most cases, the programs predate
the database.)
